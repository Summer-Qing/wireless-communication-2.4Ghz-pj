# wireless-communication-2.4Ghz-pj
Course project based on MATLAB

1. work in 2.4GHz frequency band

2. The tX power limited to be 20dbm
   noise figure is assumed to be 3db
   
   Both omnidirectional.
  
  
  
3.Design the modulation and the demodulation ! achieve 1Mbps rate a pathloss of 120db bit error rate less than 1e-3.

Fisrt consider an AWGN(Additive white Gaussian noise) channel with no ISI(Intersymble interference).
Then consider an ISI channel consisting of two taps with equal gain and the time delay betweent the two taps is microsec.
